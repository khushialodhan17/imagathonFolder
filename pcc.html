        <h3>Primary Class Curriculum</h3>
        At the Primary Wing, we believe that the mind, like a parachute, works best
         when opened. Our curriculum and evaluation procedures are designed to maximize studentsâ€™ knowledge,
          potential, and talents. Our classrooms are colorful, joyful, well-ventilated, and provide a
           friendly environment with a theme-based curriculum.
           In addition to the diverse academic and co-curricular activities, 
           our curriculum emphasizes the importance of holistic development.
            By integrating various clubs, creative arts, sports, and cultural 
            events, we ensure that students not only excel academically but also
             develop essential life skills.

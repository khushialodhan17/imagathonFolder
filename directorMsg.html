Every child is like a seed which has the potential to grow if nourished with love and care under the right guidance.
Childhood is the best time to lay the foundation of the core values essential for the overall development of the future 
citizen of tomorrow. Our mission is to provide positive and all-round motor development to every CHILD.

At DUV International School, the calibre and talent of each child is recognized and nurtured. We emphasis on LEARNING and not on 
teaching. Education is a complete process that leads to the attainment of the full potential of the child. Equal attention is given to
the development of the children both academically and in co-curricular activities like Sports, yoga, cultural activities, etc.

Education is not just about the subjects that are learnt and taught in school. The urge for knowledge is not restricted to the child. 
It is also essential for a parent and a teacher to keep adding to their own knowledge bank by keeping their eyes and ears open and by 
reading as much as possible and ensuring that children develop these habits as well.

Our focus is to develop our students as global citizens, with tolerance, respect and-appreciation of diverse cultures and religions for 
a life-time learning experience.

At DUV International School we are dedicated to exhaustive quality learning and are utterly committed to a continuous process of
improvement for the benefit of the students.

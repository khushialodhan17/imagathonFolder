    <h3>Pre-Primary Class Curriculum</h3>
    The Child Centric Curriculum in Pre-Primary education, based on the Play-way method,
     focuses on activity-based learning tailored to each child’s potential and interests.
     In addition to the diverse activities and hands-on learning experiences, the curriculum 
     emphasizes the importance of community and social interaction. Daily morning assemblies,
      interactive classroom technology, and various celebrations and events foster a sense of
       belonging and engagement among students. This holistic approach ensures that each child
        not only develops academically but also grows socially and emotionally, preparing them
         for future educational endeavors.

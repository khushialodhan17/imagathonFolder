        The curriculum for middle classes is designed to challenge 
            students to ask questions, enhance skills, conduct in-depth research, analyze findings,
             and build conceptual understanding. Each child is supported to fulfill their unique potential 
             in a balanced, student-friendly environment.In addition to fostering academic and co-curricular
              excellence, the Middle Classes Curriculum emphasizes the development of critical thinking and 
              problem-solving skills. By engaging students in diverse activities and practical learning experiences,
               we aim to nurture well-rounded individuals who are prepared to navigate the complexities of the modern
                world with confidence and creativity.
